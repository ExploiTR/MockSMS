Pratim Majumder built the **MockSMS / MockSMX** app family as **Ad-Supported applications**. These services are provided at **no cost** and are intended for use *as-is*.

This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data collection, use, and disclosure for users of any of the Mock\* apps.

### **Information Collection and Use**

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any sensitive personally identifiable information (PII)** — such as your name, phone number, SMS content, contacts, passwords, financial information, or biometric data — **in any form, at any time, through any Mock\* app**.

To provide and improve the experience, some non-sensitive technical data may be used. This data is either kept **on your device** or handled by trusted third-party services, **never collected directly** by us.

The apps use third-party services that may collect analytics or error logs:

* [AdMob (Google)](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)
* [Crashlytics (Firebase)](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

---

### **Log Data**

In the case of an error or crash, third-party tools may collect technical diagnostic information such as:

* Device IP address
* Device model and OS version
* Time and date of error
* App state/configuration during crash

This data helps identify issues and improve app stability — it is **not linked to your personal identity**.

---

### **Cookies**

The Mock\* apps do **not use cookies directly**. However, integrated third-party libraries (for ads, analytics, crash reporting) may use cookies or similar tracking tools.

You can manage cookies from your device settings. Disabling them may affect some features.

---

### **Links to Other Sites**

The app may contain links to external sites not operated by us. Please review their privacy policies separately, as we hold no responsibility for their data practices or content.

---

### **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be revised occasionally. Any changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately upon posting. You are encouraged to review it periodically.

---

### **Contact**

If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please reach out via email or in-app contact options.

**By installing or using any Mock\* app (MockSMS, MockSMX, or its variants), you automatically agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.**
